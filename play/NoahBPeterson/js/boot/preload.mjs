// preload.mjs — start fetching the engine before anybody asks for it.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT THIS EXISTS FOR. Driving the real mirror
// (https://mazesofmenace.ai/play/<owner>/) with headless Chrome, the judge's
// play page paints "press any key" at ~1.5 s and the first game frame at
// ~5.2 s. Of the 3.7 s between them, **the engine's own module tree does not
// start downloading until 1.5–3.2 s in**: the page waits out a service-worker
// registration, two worker realms spawning, a synchronous interception probe
// in each, and the fallback's head start — four to six round trips at ~320 ms
// apiece — before the first byte of `js/generated-y/**` is asked for. Nothing
// is downloading during that window and nothing is computing either.
//
// Meanwhile the page has been sitting at a keypress gate since 1.5 s. That gap
// is free bandwidth, and this file spends it: the tree the fallback rung is
// going to want is asked for at *page parse time*, from the earliest module
// the judge's page imports (js/jsmain.js), so the fetch overlaps the gate
// instead of starting after it.
//
// WHY `modulepreload` AND NOT `import()`. A preload link fetches and compiles
// a module graph without *evaluating* it. Evaluating it would run every C
// file-scope initialiser in the page realm — spending the one graph the
// main-thread rung is allowed to own, before a game has asked for one, on a
// page whose transport rung might well win. A preload only warms the cache:
// whoever imports it later gets a module-map hit and pays no network at all,
// and if nobody ever does, nothing was spent but bandwidth. Chrome (and the
// HTML spec) fetch a preloaded module's *dependencies* too, which is why four
// links cover a 180-module tree.
//
// WHY IT IS CONDITIONAL. On a fast link this is a pessimisation, not a win: the
// transport rung gets its four round trips almost free, wins the race outright,
// and needs `js/generated/**` — a *different* tree from the one preloaded here.
// Warming the wrong 2.7 MB on a link with no latency to hide costs bandwidth
// and buys nothing. So the preload is armed only when a round trip is
// expensive enough that the transport cannot win, which is exactly when the
// fallback rung is the one that will paint. See linkRttMs() for how that is
// asked, and js/boot/interactive.mjs's FALLBACK_HEAD_START_MS for the other
// half of the same policy.

// Everything this module reaches for exists only in a page. A worker realm has
// no document to put a link in, and Node has neither.

// Above this, a round trip is expensive enough that the transport rung — which
// needs the service-worker registration, a worker realm, and a synchronous
// interception probe before it can even begin fetching its engine — cannot
// paint first, and the main-thread rung is the one worth warming.
//
// The number is a measurement, not a preference. The transport's lead-in is
// four to six serialized round trips; the fallback's is two. On the mirror
// (RTT ~320 ms) that is a ~1.3 s handicap the transport never makes up, and the
// fallback wins every observed race. On loopback (RTT ~1 ms) the same handicap
// is ~5 ms and the transport wins every race, which is the behaviour worth
// keeping — it is genuinely faster per move. 25 ms is a decade of margin above
// same-machine and an order of magnitude below any real network.

// js/cmachine.js, js/yield-rt.js and friends, plus the three nhconst/nhmacro/
