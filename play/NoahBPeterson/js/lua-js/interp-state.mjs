// interp-state.mjs — get a handle on the lua_State the *interpreter* is using.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The PoC port (oracle.lua) never needed it: a level script
// only ever calls C bindings that mutate NetHack's globals, so the port can
// drive those bindings from a lua_State of its own (bridge.mjs) and nothing
// downstream can tell. dungeon.lua and quest.lua are a different shape. They
// are pure data — one assignment of a nested table to a global — and the game
// reads that table *back out of the Lua state* after the chunk returns:
//
//   init_dungeons()   (dungeon.c:1254) lua_getglobal(L,"dungeon") + lua_next
//   com_pager_core()  (questpgr.c:501) lua_getglobal(L,"questtext") + getfield
//
// A table built in a port-owned state is invisible to both. The port has to
// put its table in the state `nhl_loadlua()` was handed — and that state is a
// local variable inside transpiled C (init_dungeons / com_pager_core each call
// nhl_init() for themselves), with no global holding it and no wrappable call
// site. `gl.luacore` is a different state (nhcore.lua's) and is not it.
//
// HOW WE GET IT ANYWAY. Lua allocates its whole state as one block, through
// the allocator the embedder supplied — here nhl_alloc() -> re_alloc() ->
// realloc(), and `realloc` is the harness's (js/boot/harness.mjs). So every
// lua_State this game creates passes through JS we own. lua_newstate() asks
// for exactly sizeof(LG) bytes and lays the state out at a fixed offset inside
// that block (js/generated/lstate.js:346-362):
//
//     l = (*f)(ud, NULL, LUA_TTHREAD, 1624);   // sizeof(LG)
//     L = l + 8;                               // LUA_EXTRASPACE
//     g = l + 208;                             // &((LG *)l)->g
//     ...
//     g->mainthread = L;                       // g + 264
//     g->frealloc   = f;                       // g + 0
//
// So: watch `realloc(NULL, 1624)`, and confirm a candidate by the two fields
// lua_newstate() fills in and never changes — `g->mainthread` must point back
// at `l + 8`, and `g->frealloc` must be a function. A self-referential pointer
// at a fixed offset is not something an unrelated 1,624-byte allocation
// produces by accident, and the check is structural rather than statistical.
//
// This is the same kind of knowledge registry.mjs's levelFingerprint() already
// uses to read `levl[x][y].typ` out of `svl` — struct offsets taken from the
// transpiler's own output. It reads memory the game owns; it does not modify
// js/generated and it changes nothing when the ports are off.
//
// SAFETY. Discovery is best-effort and always verified: a port that cannot
// find its state raises rather than silently doing nothing (see registry.mjs),
// so "the port quietly stopped running and the corpus still passed" is not a
// reachable state.
