// bridge.mjs — run a hand-ported NetHack level script as readable JavaScript.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. NetHack's special levels, dungeon layout, quest text and themed
// rooms ship as ~131 .lua scripts that the game executes through a *transpiled*
// Lua 5.4.8 interpreter (js/generated/l*.js). Roadmap 1.10 ports those scripts
// to readable JS. This module is the seam that lets a ported script take the
// interpreter's place without changing one byte of observable behaviour.
//
// THE KEY OBSERVATION. A level script never touches Lua's own state in any way
// the game can see. Everything it does flows through C functions registered
// into the Lua state — des.*, selection.*, obj.*, nh.* — and every one of those
// reads its arguments off the Lua stack and then mutates NetHack's C globals
// (the level map, the object/monster chains, the RNG). The lua_State is a
// *marshalling buffer*, nothing more.
//
// So a ported script does not need Lua source, a parser, or a VM. It needs to
// (1) build the same argument values the VM would have built, and (2) invoke
// the same registered C functions in the same order. We do that by driving the
// transpiled Lua C API directly: lua_createtable / lua_pushstring / lua_setfield
// / lua_callk, exactly the calls the VM's OP_NEWTABLE / OP_SETFIELD / OP_CALL
// would have made. The lspo_* implementations are the real, unmodified,
// transpiled C — they cannot tell the difference, because there isn't one.
//
// WHY OUR OWN lua_State. The state that nhl_loadlua() is holding is a local
// variable buried in transpiled C; ES module bindings are immutable, so there
// is no way to reach it from harness JS without hand-editing js/generated
// (forbidden) or an emitter hook (out of scope). We don't need it: we make our
// own with luaL_newstate() and register the same three tables (des, selection,
// obj). The C bindings key off NetHack's globals, not off which state called
// them, so a port-owned state produces identical effects. It is created once
// per module graph (i.e. once per replay segment) and reused by every port.
//
// DETERMINISM NOTES (the traps, and why they don't bite here):
//   * Table traversal order. Nothing in sp_lev.c walks a script-supplied table
//     with lua_next; every field is read by name with lua_getfield, in an order
//     hard-coded in the C function body. Field order in a table constructor is
//     therefore unobservable — but we preserve JS object key order anyway so
//     the internal hash layout matches too.
//   * RNG order. All script-visible randomness is NetHack's rn2(); nhlib.lua's
//     math.random shim is 1 + nh.rn2(n) / base + nh.rn2(range). See rn2/random/
//     percent/shuffle/d below, which reproduce those *exactly*, and the fact
//     that a des.* call consumes its RNG inside C means call order is the only
//     thing a port has to get right.
//   * Callbacks. `contents = function() ... end` becomes a JS closure pushed
//     with lua_pushcclosure(); lspo_room() calls it through nhl_pcall_handle()
//     the same way it calls a Lua closure (lua_type() reports LUA_TFUNCTION for
//     both), so the recursion into the script body happens at the same point.
//   * Errors. The port body runs inside lua_pcallk(), mirroring the pcall that
//     nhl_loadlua() wraps the chunk in.

//
// themerms.lua is the exception, and the reason this exists. Its lua_State is

// of that branch, and created by nhl_init() with a **1 MB memory cap**
// (mklev.c:369's nhl_sandbox_info). A `selection.room()` userdata is over a

// game. The interpreter does not leak them: they are Lua locals, they become
// garbage when the room generator returns, and themerooms_post_level_generate()
// ends with lua_gc(themes, LUA_GCCOLLECT).

//                      call and long before the LUA_GCCOLLECT.
//   keepValue()      — a value that escapes into `postprocess`, i.e. survives
