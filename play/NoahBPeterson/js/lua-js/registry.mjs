// registry.mjs — which .lua scripts have a JS port, and how one takes over.
//
// INTERCEPTION POINT. Every .lua script the game runs enters the VM through
// exactly one function, nhl_loadlua() (nhlua.c:2338 / js/generated/nhlua.js:2178):
//
//     fopen(fname,"r") -> fseek/ftell/fread/fclose -> luaL_loadbufferx -> pcall
//
// That function is transpiled C. ES module bindings are immutable, and two of
// its three callers are intra-module (nhlua.js:2281, :2318), so it cannot be
// wrapped from outside without hand-editing js/generated. What *is* reachable
// is the file read itself: the harness owns fopen/fread/fclose (js/boot/
// harness.mjs) and the vendored playground behind them. So the port hooks the
// VFS:
//
//   onOpen  — if the script is ported, the bytes handed to the interpreter are
//             swapped for stubFor(): the same file, same length, same line
//             breaks, wrapped in a --[[ ]] long comment. It compiles to an
//             empty chunk. Equal length matters because nhl_loadlua does
//             alloc(buflen + 2) against NetHack's heap.
//   onClose — the port runs. That is the tightest available seam: the file has
//             been fully read, nhl_init() has already built the interpreter
//             state (and spent nhlib.lua's two align-shuffle draws), and
//             nothing has happened yet except the read. Only the Lua parse of
//             an empty chunk is reordered past the des.* calls, and parsing
//             touches neither NetHack's globals nor its RNG.
//
// OFF-BY-DEFAULT SAFETY. With both maps empty, or with C2JS_LUA_PORT=0,
// active() is false, the harness leaves luaPort null, the allocator is not
// wrapped, and not one byte of behaviour changes. The corpus is run both ways.
//
// TRACING. C2JS_LUA_TRACE=1 makes the registry active without swapping any
// bytes: it only records, per load of a ported script, the slice of the RNG log
// that script consumed. Running the same session with trace-only and with the
// port live gives a per-script RNG-consumption diff — see tools/lua-oracle.mjs.

// TWO KINDS OF PORT. A level script's whole effect is the C bindings it calls,
// so its port runs against a port-owned lua_State (bridge.mjs) and the
// interpreter's state is irrelevant. A *read-back* script — dungeon.lua,
// quest.lua — has no effect at all except the global table it leaves behind
// for C to read afterwards, so its port must build that table in the state
// nhl_loadlua() was handed. interp-state.mjs finds that state; READBACK below
// lists the scripts that need it. Everything else about the seam is the same.

 * inventory=function() … end }` puts the class leader's kit in his pack, and
 * neither object is ever on a square. A control that changed the fedora's
