/*
 *  Notes for adding new oextra structures:
 *
 *       1. Add the structure definition and any required macros in an
 *          appropriate header file that precedes this one.
 *       2. Add a pointer to your new struct to oextra struct in this file.
 *       3. Add a referencing macro to this file after the newobj macro above
 *          (see ONAME, OMONST, OMAILCMD, or OMIN for examples).
 *       4. Add a testing macro after the set of referencing macros
 *          (see has_oname(), has_omonst(), has_omailcmd(), and has_omin(),
 *          for examples).
 *       5. If your new field isn't a pointer and requires a non-zero value
 *          on initialization, add code to init_oextra() in src/mkobj.c.
 *       6. Create newXX(otmp) function and possibly free_XX(otmp) function
 *          in an appropriate new or existing source file and add a prototype
 *          for it to include/extern.h.  The majority of these are currently
 *          located in mkobj.c for convenience.
 *
 *          void newXX(struct obj *);
 *          void free_XX(struct obj *);
 *
 *          void
 *          newxx(otmp)
 *          struct obj *otmp;
 *          {
 *              if (!otmp->oextra)
 *                  otmp->oextra = newoextra();
 *              if (!XX(otmp)) {
 *                  XX(otmp) = (struct XX *) alloc(sizeof (struct xx));
 *                  (void) memset((genericptr_t) XX(otmp),
 *                                0, sizeof (struct xx));
 *              }
 *         }
 *
 *       7. Adjust size_obj() in src/cmd.c appropriately.
 *       8. Adjust dealloc_oextra() in src/mkobj.c to clean up
 *          properly during obj deallocation.
 *       9. Adjust copy_oextra() in src/mkobj.c to make duplicate
 *          copies of your struct or data onto another obj struct.
 *      10. Adjust restobj() in src/restore.c to deal with your
 *          struct or data during a restore.
 *      11. Adjust saveobj() in src/save.c to deal with your
 *          struct or data during a save.
