 * Level location types, values for 'level.locations[x][y].typ'.
 *
 * These are different from display symbols and while there is
 * similarity between the cmap subset of those, there isn't any
 * one-to-one correspondence between the two encodings.  For instance,
 * the DOOR type has multiple symbols (closed|open|gone); so does the
 * STAIRS type (down|up).  Conversely, DRAWBRIDGE_UP represents the
 * location of the projected span if the drawbridge were down but
 * there is no symbol for that; it is displayed as water, ice, lava, or
 * floor depending on what is at that spot when the bridge is 'closed'.
 *
 * [Some debugging code in src/display.c defines array type_names[]
 * which contains an entry for each of these, so needs to be kept in
 * sync if any new types are added or existing ones renumbered.  The
 * #terrain command also has a menu choice to display each map spot by
 * a letter derived from these numeric values and another choice to
 * display a legend showing the letter-to-type correspondence.  If any
 * types are added, removed, or reordered, that needs to be updated to
 * keep in synch.]
