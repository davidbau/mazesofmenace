/*
 *  Adding new mextra structures:
 *
 *       1. Add the structure definition and any required macros in this
 *          file above the mextra struct.
 *       2. Add a pointer to your new struct to the mextra struct in this
 *          file.
 *       3. Add a referencing macro at bottom of this file after the mextra
 *          struct (see MGIVENNAME, EGD, EPRI, ESHK, EMIN, or EDOG for
 *          examples).
 *       4. If your new field isn't a pointer and requires a non-zero value
 *          on initialization, add code to init_mextra() in src/makemon.c
 *       5. Create a newXX(mtmp) function and possibly a free_XX(mtmp)
 *          function in an appropriate new or existing source file and add
 *          a prototype for it to include/extern.h.
 *
 *              void newXX(struct monst *);
 *              void free_XX(struct monst *);
 *
 *              void
 *              newXX(mtmp)
 *              struct monst *mtmp;
 *              {
 *                  if (!mtmp->mextra)
 *                      mtmp->mextra = newmextra();
 *                  if (!XX(mtmp)) {
 *                      XX(mtmp) = (struct XX *) alloc(sizeof (struct XX));
 *                      (void) memset((genericptr_t) XX(mtmp),
 *                                    0, sizeof (struct XX));
 *                  }
 *              }
 *
 *       6. Consider adding a new makemon flag MM_XX flag to include/hack.h
 *          and a corresponding change to makemon() if you require your
 *          structure to be added at monster creation time.  Initialize your
 *          struct after a successful return from makemon().
 *
 *              src/makemon.c:  if (mmflags & MM_XX) newXX(mtmp);
 *              your new code:  mon = makemon(&mons[mnum], x, y, MM_XX);
 *
 *       7. Adjust size_monst() in src/wizcmds.c appropriately.
 *       8. Adjust dealloc_mextra() in src/mon.c to clean up
 *          properly during monst deallocation.
 *       9. Adjust copy_mextra() in src/mon.c to make duplicate
 *          copies of your struct or data on another monst struct.
 *      10. Adjust restmon() in src/restore.c to deal with your
 *          struct or data during a restore.
 *      11. Adjust savemon() in src/save.c to deal with your
 *          struct or data during a save.
