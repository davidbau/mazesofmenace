/* integer.h -- provide sized integer types
 *
 * We try to sort out a way to provide sized integer types
 * in here. The strong preference is to try to let a
 * compiler-supplied header file set up the types.
 *
 * If your compiler is C99 conforming and sets a value of
 * __STDC_VERSION__ >= 199901L, then <stdint.h> is supposed
 * to be available for inclusion.
 *
 * If your compiler doesn't set __STDC_VERSION__ to indicate
 * full conformance to C99, but does actually supply a suitable
 * <stdint.h>, you can pass a compiler flag -DHAS_STDINT_H
 * during build to cause the inclusion of <stdint.h> anyway.
 *
 * If <stdint.h> doesn't get included, then the code in the
 * STDINT_WORKAROUND section of code is not skipped and will
 * be used to set up the types.
 *
 * We acknowledge that some ongoing maintenance may be needed
 * over time if people send us code updates for making the
 * determination of whether <stdint.h> is available, or
 * require adjustments to the base type used for some
 * compiler/platform combinations.
