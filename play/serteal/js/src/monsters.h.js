/*
 *      Entry Format:   (from permonst.h)
 *
 *      name, symbol (S_* defines),
 *      base monster level, move rate, armor class, magic resistance,
 *      alignment, creation/geno flags (G_* defines),
 *      6 * attack structs ( type , damage-type, # dice, # sides ),
 *      weight (WT_* defines), nutritional value, extension length,
 *      sounds made (MS_* defines), physical size (MZ_* defines),
 *      resistances, resistances conferred (both MR_* defines),
 *      3 * flag bitmaps (M1_*, M2_*, and M3_* defines respectively),
 *      difficulty, symbol color.
 *
 *      The difficulty was generated in separate array monstr[] with
 *      values calculated by makedefs, but has been moved into mons[]
 *      since it rarely changes.  If a new monster is added or an old
 *      one undergoes significant change, 'makedefs -m' can be used to
 *      create a dummy monstr.c containing the calculated difficulty
 *      (of everything in mons[], not just any new or changed ones),
 *      then the value(s) can be plugged in here and monstr.c deleted.
 *      [Note that some monsters might warrant manually calculated
 *      difficulty, on a case by case basis, instead of blindly using
 *      the default value produced by makedefs.  Or fix the algorithm
 *      used by makedefs to generate a more appropriate value....]
 *
 *      TODO:  difficulty is closely related to level; its field ought
 *      to be moved sooner in the permonst struct so that it can become
 *      part of LVL() instead of remaining an orphan near the end.
 *
 *      Rule #1:        monsters of a given class are contiguous in the
 *                      mons[] array.
 *
 *      Rule #2:        monsters of a given class are generally kept in
 *                      the same order as in previous versions of NetHack
 *                      (they used to be presented in ascending order of
 *                      strength, but this rule no longer applies).
 *
 *      Rule #3:        monster frequency is included in the geno mask;
 *                      the frequency can be from 0 to 7.  0's will also
 *                      be skipped during generation.
 *
 *      Rule #4:        monster subclasses (e.g. giants) should be kept
 *                      together, unless it violates Rule 2.  NOGEN monsters
 *                      won't violate Rule 2.
 *
 * Guidelines for color assignment:
 *
 *      * Use the same color for all `growth stages' of a monster (ex.
 *        little dog/big dog, baby naga/full-grown naga.
 *
 *      * Use colors given in names wherever possible. If the class has `real'
 *        members with strong color associations, use those.
 *
 *      * Favor `cool' colors for cold-resistant monsters, `warm' ones for
 *        fire-resistant ones.
 *
 *      * Try to reserve purple (magenta) for powerful `ruler' monsters (queen
 *        bee, kobold lord, &c.).
 *
 *      * Subject to all these constraints, try to use color to make as many
 *        distinctions as the / command (that is, within a monster letter
 *        distinct names should map to distinct colors).
 *
 * The aim in assigning colors is to be consistent enough so a player can
 * become `intuitive' about them, deducing some or all of these rules
 * unconsciously. Use your common sense.
