# A Traveler's Guide to the Mazes of Menace

> *"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a lone adventurer,
> in possession of a good weapon, must be in want of a spoiler file."*

## Before You Read Further

You are holding (or more likely scrolling through) a guide to the
Mazes of Menace, the vast and ever-shifting dungeon complex that sits
beneath a place the locals just call "the dungeon entrance." What lies
below is one of the oldest and most treacherous adventure destinations
in existence: dozens of levels of corridors, vaults, and special
chambers, stretching from the relatively tame upper mines all the way
down to the molten depths of Gehennom and beyond.

People have been descending into these depths for decades. Most of them
died. The ones who made it back brought stories, and some of those
stories eventually got written down. You're reading the latest edition
of that accumulated lore.

**A word of caution.** This guide will change how you experience the
Mazes forever. Once you know that a floating eye can paralyze you with
a glance, you can never un-know it. Once you learn what a cockatrice
corpse can do when wielded with gloves, the dungeon becomes a
different place. Some adventurers prefer the thrill of discovery over
the comfort of preparation. If that's you, close this guide now and
go learn things the hard way. There is real joy in that.

But if you've died to one too many rubber-banded acid blobs, or you're
tired of starving on dungeon level four because you didn't know you
could pray — read on. We'll do our best to keep you alive.

### Choosing Your Expedition

The first decision you'll make, before you even set foot on the
stairs, is who you are. In the Mazes, this means three things: your
**role**, your **race**, and your **alignment**. Together, these
determine your starting equipment, your natural abilities, which gods
hear your prayers, and which artifacts you can safely handle.

Don't agonize over this choice too much on your first few trips. You
will die regardless, and each death teaches something. But if you'd
like a recommendation for a first expedition, read on.

#### The Roles

There are thirteen roles available to adventurers. Each comes with
different starting equipment, different intrinsic abilities gained at
various experience levels, and a different quest to complete in the
mid-game.

**Archeologist.** You start with a bullwhip, a pickaxe, and a tinning
kit. The pickaxe is quietly one of the best starting items in the
game: it lets you dig through walls and create your own escape routes from
the very first level. The tinning kit lets you preserve corpses for
later. Archeologists are capable and flexible, though a bit fragile in
early combat. You begin knowing what all gems are, which is a nice
parlor trick and occasionally useful for unicorn negotiation.
*Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.*

**Barbarian.** You start strong. Literally. A two-handed sword and
good starting strength mean you can hack through early monsters with
ease. The downside is that two-handed weapons prevent you from using a
shield, and Barbarians are not known for their finesse. You do get
poison resistance from the start, which saves you from several common
early deaths. A straightforward role for players who like straightforward
solutions. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

**Cave Dweller.** You start primitive but tough, with a club and
some rocks for throwing. You gain speed early and your hit dice are
generous. The Cave Dweller's simplicity is a virtue: fewer tools
means fewer things to manage. *Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.*

**Healer.** You begin with a stethoscope, healing potions, and poison
resistance. The stethoscope is remarkable: it lets you check a
monster's hit points and your own internal state. Healers are fragile
fighters, but their medical knowledge keeps them alive through
situations that would kill other roles. You can also see whether
potions of sickness are safe, which streamlines identification
considerably. *Alignment: Neutral.*

**Knight.** You start mounted on a pony, which is both a blessing
and a liability. The pony is a decent combatant early on but will get
you into trouble if it wanders into a shop. Knights follow a code of
conduct that penalizes attacking fleeing or peaceful monsters. You get
a lance for jousting from horseback, which is very effective when it
works. *Alignment: Lawful.*

**Monk.** You fight best with bare hands and start with no weapon at
all, which is the point. Monks gain martial arts abilities as they
level, eventually becoming formidable unarmed combatants. You start
with sleep resistance and see invisible, and you should avoid eating
meat if you want to maintain your spiritual discipline. One of the
more unusual roles, rewarding for experienced players.
*Alignment: Any.*

**Priest.** You start with holy (or unholy) water and the ability to
intuitively sense whether items are blessed, cursed, or uncursed. This
is enormously useful. You know immediately whether that cloak you just
found is safe to wear. Priests are competent fighters with access to
clerical spells and begin with a mace. *Alignment: Any (matches your
god).*

**Ranger.** You start with a bow and a generous supply of arrows,
making you one of the strongest ranged combatants early on. Rangers
get stealth and see invisible early. Your elven racial option gives
you sleep resistance on top of that. If you enjoy picking off enemies
from a distance, this is your role. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

**Rogue.** You start with a short sword, daggers for throwing, and a
sack. You get stealth from the beginning and your backstab ability
deals extra damage when you attack from hiding. Rogues are excellent
at avoiding trouble, which is often better than being good at
surviving it. *Alignment: Chaotic.*

**Samurai.** You start with a katana, which is one of the better
one-handed weapons in the game, plus a wakizashi backup and a yumi
bow with arrows. Samurai get speed early and have a strong martial
kit overall. The katana's damage output carries you through the
early game with ease. *Alignment: Lawful.*

**Tourist.** You start with a Hawaiian shirt, a credit card, a camera,
and a truly absurd number of darts. Tourists are deliberately designed
to be the hardest role in the game. Your starting equipment is mostly
a joke, your combat abilities are poor, and the dungeon seems to know
it. That said, the darts are actually useful for training ranged
skills, and the camera can blind monsters in a pinch. A role for
people who have ascended before and want a challenge.
*Alignment: Neutral.*

**Valkyrie.** You start with a long sword, a small shield, and cold
resistance. Valkyries are widely considered one of the most
beginner-friendly roles: strong combat stats, good starting equipment,
and cold resistance covers one of the more common damage types. If
you're lawful, you can dip your long sword in a fountain at experience
level 5 or higher for a chance at Excalibur. This is the
recommendation for your first serious attempt.
*Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.*

**Wizard.** You start with a quarterstaff and a spellbook or two. Your
physical combat is terrible, but you have access to the deepest magic
in the game. Wizards are extremely powerful in the late game but very
fragile early on. You'll lean heavily on your spells and need to find
ways to avoid melee combat until you're strong enough to dominate it.
If you enjoy resource management and creative problem-solving, the
Wizard is deeply satisfying. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

#### The Races

Your race affects your starting attributes, maximum attributes, and
which intrinsics you begin with or can gain.

**Human.** You know what a human is. No infravision, no poison
resistance, no particular talents. On the bright side, every role is
open to you, and nobody in the dungeon singles you out for being one.
Perfectly serviceable.

**Dwarf.** Dwarves are sturdy and strong, with infravision (they can
see warm-blooded creatures in the dark). They're good fighters and
have an affinity for mining. Available for: Archeologist, Cave Dweller,
Valkyrie.

**Elf.** Elves get sleep resistance, infravision, and a natural
affinity for bows. They're a bit more fragile than humans but have
excellent dexterity. Available for: Ranger, Wizard.

**Gnome.** Gnomes get infravision and are comfortable underground.
They're small but resourceful. Available for: Archeologist, Cave
Dweller, Healer, Ranger, Wizard.

**Orc.** Orcs get infravision and poison resistance, which is genuinely
useful. They tend to have high strength but low charisma. The trade-off
is that some shopkeepers are less friendly. Available for: Barbarian,
Ranger, Rogue, Wizard.

#### Alignment

Your alignment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic) determines which gods
you worship, which artifacts you can safely use, and how certain
actions affect your standing. It's tempting to think of these as
"good," "balanced," and "evil," but it's more nuanced than that.

The key thing to understand about alignment is that it's a number.
Every action that matches your alignment's expectations increases it;
actions that violate your alignment's code decrease it. Your alignment
record affects your relationship with your god, which in turn affects
whether prayer will save you or smite you.

**Lawful** characters should avoid attacking peaceful creatures and
should never murder. Sacrifice frequently at co-aligned altars.
Lawful has the advantage of access to Excalibur, one of the best
weapons in the game, obtainable as early as experience level 5.

**Neutral** characters have the most flexibility. You can get away
with more than a Lawful character, but your god still frowns on
truly chaotic behavior. Neutral has access to some excellent quest
artifacts.

**Chaotic** characters can kill with relative impunity but should
avoid pious behavior that doesn't match their dark patron's
expectations. Chaotic is often paired with Rogue for thematic
consistency.

For your first game: **Lawful Valkyrie, Human or Dwarf.** Strong
combat, cold resistance, and the Excalibur path. It's the closest
thing to an easy mode the Mazes offer, which is to say it's still
very hard.

### What to Pack

Any good travel guide will tell you what to bring. Ours has the
awkward job of telling you that you don't get to choose. Your
starting kit is determined by your role, and you'll descend with
whatever your role provides, no more.

What you *can* choose is what to prioritize once you're down there.
Every role starts with equipment suited to its strengths. The
important thing isn't what's in your pack on turn one; it's knowing
what to scavenge from the first few levels to shore up your
weaknesses.

#### The Early Shopping List

No matter your role, here's what you should be looking for:

**A source of nutrition.** You will get hungry. It happens faster than
you think. Food rations are the gold standard: 800 nutrition each,
they never spoil. Grab every food ration you see. If you're a role
that starts with tripe rations, those are fine for your pet but
genuinely unpleasant for you. Eat them only if you must.

**A way to identify things.** In the early game, your primary
identification tools are altars (drop items to see if they flash
blessed/cursed), your pet (it won't step on cursed items), and
experimentation. A scroll of identify is valuable, but you might not
find one for a while. A touchstone (a gray stone that identifies gems)
is helpful but not urgent.

**Armor improvements.** Whatever you're wearing, you can probably do
better. Look for cloaks, helmets, gloves, and boots to fill empty
equipment slots. Even basic items like a helmet or pair of gloves
provide armor class benefits and can protect against specific attacks.

**A ranged attack.** Daggers, darts, or a bow with arrows. Fighting
from range is almost always safer than melee, and some monsters (like
floating eyes) should never be fought in melee at all.

**A light source.** Many areas of the dungeon are dark, and bumbling
around blind is a recipe for walking into things you'd rather see
coming. An oil lamp or magic lamp is ideal. A candle or two will do
in a pinch.

---

### Your First Descent

You step down the stairs. The air is cool and damp. A corridor
stretches before you, branching into darkness. Your pet (a little dog
or kitten, depending on your inclinations) trots along behind you.

Welcome to the dungeon.

The first few levels of the Mazes are designed to ease you in, which
is a relative term. Monsters are weaker, but you are too. Your gear is
minimal, your hit points are low, and you don't yet have the
resistances that make the mid-game survivable. More experienced
adventurers will tell you that levels one through five are where the
most characters die, not because the threats are the greatest, but
because you have the fewest resources to deal with them.

#### The Golden Rules of Early Survival

**Rule 1: Don't fight what you can't beat.** This sounds obvious, but
it's the single most violated principle in the Mazes. If a monster is
too tough for you, walk away. Use corridors as chokepoints. Funnel
enemies so you fight them one at a time. If you stumble into a room
full of monsters, step back into the corridor and force them to come
to you in single file.

```
  Bad: fighting in the open        Good: corridor chokepoint

  ┌─────·──────┐                   ┌─────·──────┐
  │·Z··Z·······│                   │·Z···Z······│
  │··Z·@·Z·Z···│                   │··Z··Z······│
  │····Z·······│                   │·Z··········+##@
  │··Z·········│                   │··Z·········│
  └────────────┘                   └────────────┘

  You're surrounded.               They come to you one at a time.
```

**Rule 2: Don't eat things you don't understand.** Monster corpses
can grant powerful intrinsics, or they can poison you, give you food
poisoning, or worse. Until you know what a corpse does, leave it on
the ground. The exceptions: you can always safely eat food rations,
lembas wafers, cram rations, and fruits. Lichen corpses are safe and
never rot. Lizard corpses are safe, never rot, and cure
petrification. Always carry one if you can.

**Rule 3: Your pet is your friend.** Your starting pet is more useful
than it appears. It will fight alongside you, pick up items (which
tells you they're not cursed, since pets avoid cursed items on the ground),
and can even be trained to steal from shops. Keep it fed by dropping
tripe rations or corpses near it. A healthy, well-fed pet is one of
your best early assets.

**Rule 4: Learn to pray.** If you are about to die (hit points
critically low, starving, turning to stone) you
can pray to your god for help. In the early game, with decent
alignment, prayer will almost certainly save you. But you can only
pray about once every 300-500 turns, and praying at the wrong time
(when your god is angry, when you're in Gehennom, or when you've
prayed too recently) can make things much worse. Think of prayer as an
emergency button with a cooldown. Don't waste it on minor problems.
We'll cover the details in [Divine Relations](#divine-relations).

**Rule 5: Explore thoroughly but move purposefully.** Every turn you
spend in the dungeon costs nutrition. If you stand around for hundreds
of turns, you'll starve. But rushing past rooms means missing
items you need. The sweet spot is to explore each level fairly
completely (check rooms, open doors, look for hidden passages) but
don't grind. When you've found what the level has to offer, move on.

#### Things That Will Kill You (And How to Avoid Them)

Here's a short list of common early deaths and how to prevent them:

**Starvation.** Eat when you're Hungry (the status message), not
when you're Weak or Fainting. If you're Fainting, pray immediately.
Pick up every food ration you find.

**Floating eyes.** They're the `e` on the map. Small, blue, and
seemingly harmless. If you hit one in melee, you'll be paralyzed, and
every monster in the vicinity will take free shots at your frozen body.
Use ranged attacks, or just walk around them. They don't pursue you.

**Rotted corpses.** If you eat a corpse that's been on the ground too
long, you'll get food poisoning, which is lethal without treatment.
Eat corpses fresh (within a few turns of the kill) or not at all.
If you do get food poisoning, pray immediately.

**Falling down stairs while overburdened.** If you're carrying too
much, taking the stairs can cause you to tumble and take significant
damage. Drop items before descending, or manage your inventory.

**Killer bees.** They come in swarms, they're fast, and in the early
game, a group of them can overwhelm you. If you see one bee, expect
more. Use a corridor to fight them one at a time.

**Your own pet.** If your pet is between you and a narrow corridor,
you might accidentally swap places with it repeatedly instead of
moving. Worse, if you attack it (because you got confused or forgot
it was there), you lose alignment and trust. Be aware of where your
pet is.

## Part Two: Reading the Terrain

### The Lay of the Land

The Mazes are procedurally generated. No two visits are quite the
same. But the dungeon follows patterns, and understanding those
patterns is the first step toward navigating them effectively.

#### The Big Picture

Before we talk about what the symbols mean, here's the overall
shape of the place. The dungeon is a branching tree, and knowing
where you are in it helps you plan your route:

```
  Dungeons of Doom (levels 1-29ish)
    │
    ├── The Gnomish Mines (branch around level 2-4)
    │     ├── Minetown (shops and a temple)
    │     └── Mine's End (bottom: luckstone)
    │
    ├── Sokoban (branch around level 5-9, goes UP)
    │     └── Top: bag of holding or amulet of reflection
    │
    ├── Your Quest (portal around level 11-16)
    │     └── Unique to your role. Get your quest artifact.
    │
    ├── Fort Ludios (portal, if you find it)
    │     └── A vault full of gold and soldiers
    │
    ├── Medusa's Island (level ~25)
    │
    └── The Castle (level ~27, bottom of Dungeons of Doom)
          │
          Gehennom (levels 28-50ish)
            │
            ├── Vlad's Tower (contains the Candelabrum)
            │
            ├── The Wizard's Tower (Wizard of Yendor, Book of the Dead)
            │
            └── Moloch's Sanctum (bottom: the Amulet of Yendor)
                  │
                  (now go ALL the way back up)
                  │
                  The Elemental Planes
                    Earth ─► Air ─► Fire ─► Water
                      │
                      The Astral Plane (three altars, pick the right one)
                        │
                        ASCENSION
```

The typical trip: go down through the Dungeons, detour into the
Mines for a luckstone and Minetown's shops, clear Sokoban for a
prize, do your Quest, reach the Castle, descend through Gehennom
to get the Amulet, then climb all the way back up and through the
Planes. Simple enough on paper. Surviving it is another matter.

#### The Map Symbols

Everything in the dungeon is represented by a symbol on the screen.
Learning to read these symbols quickly is essential:

| Symbol   | Meaning                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `.`      | Floor (room)                  |
| `#`      | Corridor                      |
| `-`  `│` | Wall (horizontal, vertical)   |
| `+`      | Closed door (or spellbook)    |
| `<`      | Stairs up                     |
| `>`      | Stairs down                   |
| `{`      | Fountain                      |
| `_`      | Altar                         |
| `\`      | Throne                        |
| `#`      | Sink (in a kitchen)           |
| `^`      | Trap (once revealed)          |
| `@`      | You (or a human-type monster) |

Letters represent monsters: `d` for dogs, `D` for dragons, `Z` for
zombies. Colors help distinguish within a class: a red `D` is a red
dragon, while a gray `D` is a gray dragon. We'll cover this in detail
in [A Field Guide to Dungeon Fauna](#a-field-guide-to-dungeon-fauna).

Item symbols are punctuation marks:

| Symbol | Item Class         |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| `)`    | Weapons            |
| `[`    | Armor              |
| `%`    | Food (comestibles) |
| `!`    | Potions            |
| `?`    | Scrolls            |
| `/`    | Wands              |
| `=`    | Rings              |
| `"`    | Amulets            |
| `(`    | Tools              |
| `+`    | Spellbooks         |
| `*`    | Gems and stones    |
| `$`    | Gold               |

#### Room Types

Most rooms in the dungeon are ordinary, empty or with a few items
and monsters scattered about. But some rooms are special:

```
  A shop:                 A zoo:                  A throne room:
  ┌───────┐               ┌────────┐              ┌────────┐
  │··[·?!·│               │Z··Z$Z··│              │··Z·Z·Z·│
  │···@···│               │$Z···$Z·│              │·Z·\··Z·│
  │!··)·/·│               │·Z$Z··Z$│              │··Z·Z···│
  └──+────┘               └───+────┘              └───+────┘
      #                       #                       #
  @ = shopkeeper          Z = sleeping monsters    \ = throne
  Items are for sale.     $ = piles of gold        Monsters guard it.
```

**Shops.** Identified by the shopkeeper standing in the doorway (or
inside). Shops sell items of a particular type: general
stores, armor shops, weapon shops, scroll shops, potion shops, and
more. Items on the shop floor belong to the shopkeeper; pick one up
and you'll be quoted a price. You can sell items too. Shopkeepers are
extremely powerful in combat, so don't steal unless you have a plan.

**Temples.** A room with an altar and a priest or priestess tending
it. The altar's alignment matters: if it matches yours, you can
sacrifice here for good effects. If it doesn't, the resident priest
won't be friendly about your attempts.

**Throne rooms.** A room with a throne (`\`) and usually surrounded
by monsters. Sitting on the throne has random effects, sometimes
wonderful, sometimes terrible. See
[Points of Interest](#points-of-interest).

**Zoos.** A room packed with sleeping monsters and gold. If you open
the door, they all wake up. Fight from the doorway and pick them off
one at a time.

**Barracks.** A room full of soldiers. They're organized and armed,
but they're also carrying good equipment. Worth clearing if you can
handle the fight.

**Beehives.** A room full of killer bees and royal jelly. The bees
are dangerous in numbers, but royal jelly is excellent food.

**Themed rooms.** Newer editions of the dungeon include a variety
of themed rooms: collections of specific monster types, item caches,
and environmental setups. These are too varied to catalog completely
here, but they add welcome variety to the standard layout.

---

### Points of Interest

The dungeon contains several types of special features worth knowing
about. Each offers both opportunities and risks.

#### Fountains `{`

Fountains are sources of water that can be quaffed from or dipped
into. Both actions carry risk and reward.

**Quaffing from a fountain** has many possible outcomes:

| Outcome         | Effect                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Wish granted    | A water demon appears and grants a wish (rare, ~1/30) |
| Water demon     | A hostile water demon appears                         |
| Healing         | You regain hit points                                 |
| Attribute boost | A random attribute increases                          |
| Attribute loss  | A random attribute decreases                          |
| Water moccasin  | Snakes appear                                         |
| See invisible   | You gain the ability to see invisible creatures       |
| Nothing         | "The water is cool and refreshing"                    |

**Dipping in a fountain** is most notable for one thing: if you are
Lawful and at least experience level 5, dipping a long sword may
transform it into Excalibur, one of the best weapons in the game.
Otherwise, dipping can rust metallic items, create hostile water
creatures, or occasionally bless the dipped item.

The conventional wisdom is: if you're a lawful character with a long
sword, dip in every fountain you find until you get Excalibur. If
you're not lawful, fountains are mostly a trap. The risks outweigh
the benefits.

#### Altars `_`

Altars are among the most useful features in the dungeon, especially
for identification.

**Dropping items on an altar** reveals their blessed/cursed/uncursed
status:
- **Amber flash** → the item is blessed
- **Black flash** → the item is cursed
- No flash → the item is uncursed

This is the cheapest and most reliable way to check items in the
early game. Always clear a path to an altar and ferry suspicious
items there for testing.

**Sacrificing monster corpses on an altar** builds your relationship
with your god. Fresh corpses are required (old ones won't do). The
bigger the monster, the better the sacrifice. Eventually, sufficient
sacrifice may summon an artifact weapon aligned to your cause. See
[Divine Relations](#divine-relations) for full details.

**Converting an altar** is possible by offering a same-race corpse of
a different alignment on it. This is useful if you find an altar that
doesn't match your alignment.

#### Thrones `\`

Sitting on a throne is a gamble. The possible effects include:

- A wish (if your luck is positive)
- Genocide of a monster class
- Free identification of items in your pack
- A stat boost or stat drain
- An electric shock
- Full healing
- Summoning a crowd of hostile monsters
- Confusion
- A curse on one of your items
- Magic mapping of the level
- Gaining see invisible
- Losing all your gold

The odds aren't terrible (about one in six for something to happen
at all) but the variance is wild. Sit on a throne when you can
afford to deal with the worst outcome.

#### Sinks `#`

Sinks are found in kitchens and have a few uses:

- **Kicking a sink** can produce a black pudding (dangerous!) or a
  ring, or just hurt your foot
- **Quaffing from a sink** can have various minor effects
- **Dropping a ring down a sink** produces a characteristic message
  that can help identify the ring type. This is one of the more
  reliable non-magical identification methods for rings

### A Field Guide to Dungeon Fauna

The Mazes are home to hundreds of monster species, organized into
classes denoted by letters. Lowercase letters are generally smaller
or less dangerous; uppercase letters are larger or more threatening.
Color further distinguishes individual species within a class.

Here is a quick field guide to what each letter means, roughly ordered
by how early you might encounter them:

#### Common Early Encounters

| Symbol | Class     | Notes                                                                                   |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a`    | Ants      | Come in groups. Soldier ants are fast and hit hard.                                     |
| `b`    | Blobs     | Acidic or gelatinous. Don't hit acid blobs in melee.                                    |
| `d`    | Dogs      | Often your starting pet. Tame dogs are loyal. Wild ones are manageable.                 |
| `e`    | Eyes      | **Floating eyes paralyze on melee hit.** Never hit an `e` in melee. Use ranged attacks. |
| `f`    | Cats      | Like dogs, often starting pets. Felines can be tamed with tripe.                        |
| `g`    | Gnomes    | Common in the Mines. Usually peaceful if you're a gnome.                                |
| `h`    | Humanoids | Dwarves, bugbears, mind flayers. Wide range of difficulty.                              |
| `i`    | Imps      | Minor pests. Can steal and teleport.                                                    |
| `j`    | Jellies   | Spotted and ochre jellies. Passive acid damage on melee.                                |
| `k`    | Kobolds   | Weak individually but sometimes carry poisoned weapons.                                 |
| `r`    | Rodents   | Rats and rock moles. Rock moles eat metal items, so protect your gear.                  |
| `s`    | Spiders   | Cave spiders are weak. Giant spiders poison.                                            |
| `:`    | Lizards   | Important! Lizard corpses cure petrification. Always carry one.                         |

#### Mid-Dungeon Threats

| Symbol | Class             | Notes                                                                                                |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`    | Angels            | Powerful, usually aligned. Don't fight your own.                                                     |
| `C`    | Centaurs          | Fast, good archers. Mountain centaurs hit hard.                                                      |
| `E`    | Elementals        | Hard to kill. Air elementals engulf; earth elementals phase through walls.                           |
| `F`    | Fungi             | Yellow mold, green mold, shriekers. Shriekers summon other monsters.                                 |
| `G`    | Gnome lords/kings | Tougher gnomes. Still fairly manageable.                                                             |
| `H`    | Giants            | Strong melee, throw boulders. Giants carry gems.                                                     |
| `L`    | Liches            | Spellcasters. Arch-liches are among the most dangerous monsters in the game.                         |
| `M`    | Mummies           | Drain experience on hit. Mummy wrappings are useless but the corpses give cold resistance sometimes. |
| `N`    | Nymphs            | Steal items from your inventory, then teleport away. Fight from range.                               |
| `O`    | Ogres             | Strong melee fighters. Ogre lords and kings are tougher.                                             |
| `P`    | Puddings          | Black puddings split when hit with iron weapons. Don't use iron.                                     |
| `S`    | Snakes            | Cobras and pit vipers poison. Water moccasins come from fountains.                                   |
| `T`    | Trolls            | Regenerate. They come back from the dead unless you eat or tin the corpse.                           |
| `U`    | Umber hulk        | Confuses on sight. Avoid looking at them directly.                                                   |
| `W`    | Wraiths           | Drain levels on hit. But their corpses grant a level, so eat them fresh.                             |
| `Y`    | Yetis             | Tough melee combatants. Corpses may grant cold resistance.                                           |
| `Z`    | Zombies           | Slow, numerous, come in many varieties. Zombie corpses are old and will rot.                         |

#### Things You Don't Want to Meet

| Symbol | Class            | Notes                                                                                                    |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `c`    | Cockatrices      | **Touch = instant petrification.** Never hit one barehanded. Wield their corpse with gloves as a weapon. |
| `D`    | Dragons          | Each color has a different breath weapon and resistance. Gray dragons are prized for scale mail.         |
| `h`    | Mind flayers     | Drain intelligence on hit. **If Int reaches 0, you die.** Keep distance or kill fast.                    |
| `V`    | Vampires         | Drain levels. Vampire lords fly and are fast.                                                            |
| `;`    | Sea monsters     | Drowning is an instadeath. Don't fight in water without a plan.                                          |
| `&`    | Demons           | Major demons (Orcus, Demogorgon, Asmodeus) are boss-level threats.                                       |
| `@`    | Humans (hostile) | Includes the Wizard of Yendor, who is the most persistent nuisance in the game.                          |

We'll cover specific monsters in much more detail in the individual
sections. For now, remember the essentials: **never melee a floating
eye, always carry a lizard corpse, and respect anything with `D` or
`&` on your screen.**

## Part Four: Gear and Provisions

### The Identification Problem

Here is the central puzzle of the Mazes, and the thing that kills
more promising expeditions than any monster: you will find dozens of
items, and you won't know what most of them are.

That potion might heal you or it might make you hallucinate. That
scroll could enchant your armor or destroy it. That ring could grant
you invisibility or slowly starve you to death. In the Mazes,
ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is death by unidentified wand.

Every game, the dungeon shuffles the deck. Potions, scrolls, wands,
rings, amulets, and spellbooks are all given randomized appearances.
The "milky potion" in this game might be healing; in your next game
it might be paralysis. The only things that stay consistent between
games are the item classes themselves (a `!` is always a potion, a
`?` is always a scroll) and the prices, which turn out to be the
single most powerful identification tool you have.

#### Blessed, Uncursed, Cursed

Before you can worry about *what* an item is, you need to know
*what condition* it's in. Every item in the Mazes is blessed, uncursed,
or cursed (BUC for short). This affects how the item behaves, often
dramatically:

- A **blessed** scroll of identify will reveal all items in your pack.
  A cursed one identifies only a single item.
- A **cursed** piece of armor cannot be removed once worn.
- A **cursed** potion of gain level sends you up through the ceiling
  to the level above instead of granting an experience level.

You don't see BUC status by default (Priests are the exception; they
sense it naturally). But there are several reliable ways to check:

**Altar testing.** Drop an item on an altar. An amber flash means
blessed. A black flash means cursed. No flash means uncursed. This is
free, fast, and unlimited. If you find an altar early, use it heavily.

**Pet testing.** Your pet won't step on cursed items. If you drop
something and your dog walks around it, it's cursed. If the dog walks
over it (or picks it up), it's safe. Not as precise as an altar, but
works anywhere.

**Holy water.** Dipping an item in blessed water (holy water) will
uncurse or bless it. Dipping in cursed water (unholy water) will curse
it. Holy water is precious in the early game, so save it for items
you've already identified.

**Scroll of identify.** A blessed scroll of identify will identify
everything in your pack at once. This is the gold standard, but you
need to identify the scroll first (irony noted) and bless it.

#### The Price Is Right

Shopkeepers are, without exaggeration, your most important
identification tool. Every unidentified item has a fixed base price
that depends on what it actually is. When you pick up an item in a
shop, the shopkeeper quotes you a price derived from that base price,
modified by your Charisma and the shopkeeper's markup.

The key insight: items in the same category that share a base price
are in the same **price group**. If you know the price, you can
narrow down the possibilities enormously, sometimes to just two or
three candidates.

Here's how to do it. Pick up an item in a shop and note the price
quoted. The quote will be higher than base price (shopkeepers mark
up). With average Charisma, the sell price is typically one third of
base and the buy price is roughly double. You don't need to memorize
exact formulas. What matters is grouping: items quoted at similar
prices are in the same price tier.

The price tables for each item class follow. These are your
field reference for shopping trips.

##### Scroll Prices

| Base Price | Scrolls                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $20        | identify                                                                                                          |
| $50        | light                                                                                                             |
| $60        | blank paper, enchant weapon                                                                                       |
| $80        | enchant armor, remove curse                                                                                       |
| $100       | confuse monster, destroy armor, fire, food detection, gold detection, magic mapping, scare monster, teleportation |
| $200       | amnesia, create monster, earth, taming                                                                            |
| $300       | charging, genocide, punishment, stinking cloud                                                                    |

The $100 group is crowded, which makes scroll price-ID less precise
than other categories. But you can still narrow things down. If a
scroll is in the $20 group, it's identify. Period. That's one of the
most useful scrolls in the game and you just found it for free.

##### Potion Prices

| Base Price | Potions                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $50        | booze, fruit juice, see invisible, sickness                                        |
| $100       | confusion, extra healing, hallucination, healing, restore ability, sleeping, water |
| $150       | blindness, gain energy, invisibility, monster detection, object detection          |
| $200       | enlightenment, full healing, levitation, polymorph, speed                          |
| $250       | acid, oil                                                                          |
| $300       | gain ability, gain level, paralysis                                                |

Water is always the "clear" potion, so if you see "clear potion" you
know what it is without even checking the price. The $50 group is
tricky because sickness and see invisible are in there together (one
very good, one very bad). The $200 group is packed with excellent
potions.

##### Ring Prices

| Base Price | Rings                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $100       | adornment, hunger, protection, protection from shape changers, stealth, sustain ability, warning                                                                           |
| $150       | aggravate monster, cold resistance, gain constitution, gain strength, increase accuracy, increase damage, invisibility, poison resistance, see invisible, shock resistance |
| $200       | fire resistance, free action, levitation, regeneration, searching, slow digestion, teleportation                                                                           |
| $300       | conflict, polymorph, polymorph control, teleport control                                                                                                                   |

The $300 group is extremely informative: only four rings live there,
and three of them (conflict, polymorph control, teleport control) are
among the most powerful in the game.

##### Wand Prices

| Base Price | Wands                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $100       | light, nothing                                                                                                                                                 |
| $150       | digging, enlightenment, locking, magic missile, make invisible, opening, probing, secret door detection, slow monster, speed monster, striking, undead turning |
| $175       | cold, fire, lightning, sleep                                                                                                                                   |
| $200       | cancellation, create monster, polymorph, teleportation                                                                                                         |
| $500       | death, wishing                                                                                                                                                 |

If a wand costs $500, you are having a very good day.

##### Amulet Prices

All amulets have a base price of $150 except the cheap Amulet of
Yendor imitations ($0). Price doesn't help here. You'll need to rely
on other methods.

#### The Engrave Test (Wands)

This is the single most useful trick for wand identification and
costs you nothing. Apply a wand by engraving on the floor with it
(command: `E`, then select the wand). What happens tells you what
the wand is:

```
  What you see when you engrave:          Wand type
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  "A lit field surrounds you"             light
  Your engraving vanishes                 cancellation/make invisible
  "Bugs appear in the engraving"          create monster  (no bugs)
  You feel self-knowledgeable             enlightenment
  "The engraving in the floor is gone"    polymorph/teleportation
  Your engraving is smudged               secret door detection  (no)
  The floor is riddled by holes           digging
  The bugs on the floor stop moving       sleep
  Lightning strikes the engraving         lightning
  The engraving is covered in frost       cold
  The engraving catches fire              fire
  Nothing happens (but a charge is used)  nothing
  You write in the dust                   all BEAM wands (1 charge used)
```

The engrave test costs one charge per wand but preserves the rest.
With one zap you can sort most wands into clear categories. For BEAM
wands (which just write in the dust like a finger), you'll need
further testing: try zapping them at a monster or in a safe direction.

Crucially, engraving with a wand of wishing does nothing special.
It just uses a charge. So if you suspect you have a wand of wishing
($500 price), do NOT engrave with it. Zap it directly.

#### The Sink Test (Rings)

If you find a sink (usually in a kitchen), you can drop a ring down
it. Each ring type produces a characteristic message:

```
  Message you hear or see:                Ring type
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  "The water flow seems fixed"            sustain ability
  "The water flow seems stronger/weaker"  gain constitution/gain strength
  "The sink quivers upward"               levitation
  "You smell rotten <fruit>"              poison resistance
  "Several flies buzz angrily"            protection from shape changers
  "Static electricity surrounds the sink" shock resistance
  "The water flow seems lesser/greater"   increase damage/increase accuracy
  "The cold water faucet flashes brightly" fire resistance
  "The hot water faucet flashes brightly" cold resistance
  "The sink seems to blend into the floor" stealth
  "You don't see anything happen"         invisibility (but the sink vanished!)
  "You thought your ring got lost..."     searching
  "You hear a loud grinding sound"        aggravate monster
  "The sink glows silver"                 free action
  "The water flow hits the bottom"        hunger
  "You see the ring slide right down"     slow digestion (never lost in sink)
  "The sink looks as good as new"         regeneration
  "You see a ring shining in its center"  adornment
  "The faucets flash from the water"      warning
  "The sink momentarily vanishes"         teleportation
  "The sink looks nothing like a deck"    polymorph (it briefly changes)
  "The sink starts running like crazy"    conflict
  "You hear a strange wind"              teleport control
  "The sink seemingly makes no change"    polymorph control
  "The ring is regurgitated"              protection
```

You have about a 95% chance of losing the ring each time, so only
test rings you're willing to sacrifice. The two exceptions: searching
and slow digestion rings are never lost.

#### Use-Testing (The Careful Way)

When you don't have access to a shop or a sink, you can sometimes
figure out what an item is by using it carefully. Here's the approach
for each category:

**Potions.** The safest test is to throw a potion at a monster and
observe the effect. Throwing avoids the risk of drinking something
lethal. If a potion heals the monster, it's some kind of healing
potion. If the monster speeds up, it's speed. If the monster becomes
invisible, well, you've learned something (and now have an invisible
monster to deal with).

You can also dip items into potions. Dipping a weapon into a potion
of sickness will poison it, confirming the potion's identity. Dipping
a unicorn horn into a potion of confusion, hallucination, or sickness
will turn it into water.

**Scrolls.** Reading is risky. Some scrolls (destroy armor, amnesia,
punishment) are genuinely harmful. The safest approach is to price-ID
first, then read scrolls from safe price groups. If you must test
blind: take off your armor before reading a scroll that might be
destroy armor. Read from a position where teleportation won't be
disastrous.

Confused reading produces different effects for many scrolls and is
sometimes useful. A confused scroll of remove curse, for example,
will *curse* items instead.

**Rings.** First, confirm the ring is not cursed (altar or pet test).
Then put it on. Many rings produce an immediate message or visible
effect: you start levitating, you become invisible, you feel
stronger. If nothing obvious happens, check your stats and inventory
for subtle changes (protection, searching). Take it off quickly if
you start feeling hungry faster than normal (hunger ring) or if
monsters seem to be approaching more aggressively (aggravate monster).

**Amulets.** Most amulets are safe to wear briefly. Put it on, wait
a few turns, take it off. The dangerous ones (strangulation, restful
sleep) are usually cursed, so check BUC first. An amulet of ESP
reveals itself if you go blind while wearing it (you'll see monsters
as brain-shapes). Amulet of reflection is trickier to detect, but
you'll notice it when a ray bounces off you.

**Armor.** Try it on (after checking it's not cursed). Magical armor
reveals itself immediately: speed boots make you faster, a cloak of
invisibility makes you invisible. Mundane armor is identifiable by
its appearance (the "old gloves" are leather gloves, "riding boots"
are fumble boots, and so on).

Here's a useful table of boot and helmet appearances:

```
  Appearance:          Possible identities:
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  mud boots            elven boots (stealth)
  buckled boots        kicking boots
  riding boots         fumble boots (often cursed!)
  snow boots           levitation boots (often cursed!)
  hiking boots         jumping boots
  combat boots         speed boots
  jungle boots         water walking boots

  conical hat          dunce cap OR cornuthaum
  plumed helmet        regular helmet
  etched helmet        helm of brilliance
  crested helmet       helm of opposite alignment
  visored helmet       helm of telepathy
```

#### Naming What You've Learned

As you gather clues, use the `#name` command (or `N`) to track what
you know. You can **call** an entire item class by a name you choose.
For example, if you've determined that "fizzy potions" are in the $200
price group, call them "fizzy=$200" so you don't forget. If you later
throw one at a monster and it speeds up, you can rename the class to
"speed."

This habit of annotating your discoveries is what separates adventurers
who die on level 8 from adventurers who reach the Castle. The dungeon
doesn't keep notes for you. You have to do it yourself.

#### A Practical Strategy

All of these techniques combine into a workflow. Here's what a
seasoned traveler does on a typical descent:

**At an altar** (priority one). Ferry everything you've found to the
altar. Drop each item. Sort your pack into blessed, uncursed, and
cursed piles. Wield or wear the blessed stuff. Stash or discard the
cursed stuff.

**At a shop** (priority two). Pick up and put down unidentified items
to get price quotes. Group them by price. Cross-reference with the
tables above. Suddenly half your inventory is narrowed to two or three
possibilities.

**Engrave-test your wands** as soon as you find them. It's fast, it
costs only one charge, and it immediately sorts wands into categories.
A wand that digs the floor is digging. A wand that freezes your
engraving is cold. Simple.

**Experiment cautiously** with the rest. Wear non-cursed rings one at
a time. Throw potions at monsters. Read scrolls from safe price groups
after removing your armor.

**Save your scrolls of identify** for the items that resist other
methods: amulets (all the same price), spellbooks (dangerous to
read if unknown), and the one stubborn potion in the $50 group that
you can't quite pin down.

```
  The Identification Flowchart:

     Found an item
          │
          ▼
     Can you reach an altar? ──yes──► Drop it. Check BUC.
          │no
          ▼
     Is your pet nearby? ──yes──► Drop it. Does pet avoid it?
          │no                         │yes: it's cursed
          ▼                           │no: it's safe (uncursed/blessed)
     Can you reach a shop? ──yes──► Check the price. Consult tables.
          │no
          ▼
     Is it a wand? ──yes──► Engrave-test it.
          │no
          ▼
     Is it a ring + sink nearby? ──yes──► Drop it in the sink.
          │no
          ▼
     Is it safe to use-test? ──yes──► Try it carefully.
          │no
          ▼
     Save a scroll of identify for it.
```

The whole system is about reducing uncertainty with the cheapest,
safest method first. Altars and shops are free. Engrave-testing costs
one charge. Use-testing costs more and carries risk. Scrolls of
identify are the expensive last resort. Work through the list in order
and you'll rarely be surprised.

### What Changed Since Last Time

If you're an experienced traveler returning after some time away, the
current edition of the Mazes includes several notable changes from the
version you may remember. The most significant:

- **Themed rooms** are now a regular feature of dungeon generation.
  You'll encounter rooms with specific monster or item themes that
  didn't exist before.
- **Four new monster species**: the displacer beast, genetic
  engineer, gold dragon, and baby gold dragon now roam the Mazes.
- **The helm of caution** is a new piece of armor.
- **Mind flayers** no longer cause amnesia (they still drain
  Intelligence, which can still kill you).
- **Unicorn horns** no longer restore lost attributes. This is a
  major change. In previous editions, the unicorn horn was a
  cure-all; now you'll need other solutions.
- **Dragon scale mail** now provides two extrinsic resistances
  instead of one. This makes it even more desirable.
- **Bags of holding** no longer destroy their contents on explosion.
  Items are scattered on the floor instead, which is bad but not
  catastrophic.
- **Sacrifice** for artifact generation now requires a minimum
  sacrifice value.
- **Gehennom** levels are more varied and interesting.
- **Special levels** can now generate mirrored (flipped), so don't
  rely on fixed maps.
- **Monsters** can now use containers and unlock chests.
