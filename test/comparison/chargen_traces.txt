   2|                            After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
   3|                            against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
   4|                            Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
   5|                            the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
   6|                            and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
   7|                            Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.
   9|                        Your god Set seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
  10|                        to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.
  12|                        You, a newly trained Plunderer, have been heralded
  13|                        from birth as the instrument of Set.  You are destined
  14|                        to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die in the
  15|                        attempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For the sake
  16|                        of us all:  Go bravely with Set!

   3|                        against the authority of Marduk the Creator.

   5|                        the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
   6|                        and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
   7|                        Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.
   9|      -----         Your goddess Brigit seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
  10|      |...|         to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.
